# Welcome to Cathedrale 
Cathedrale is a fictional alternative clothing store website, originally created as a coding and wireframing project for school. The design and wireframes were built in Adobe XD, and eversince, I strictly use Figma. Since this is a prototype, it isn’t fully navigable but demonstrates the intended user flow.

### Key Features:
- **User Flow**: Users start on the "Home" page, can navigate to "Clothes," and explore product pages like "leather pants" to view item details. The "favorites" and "cart" buttons are active and functional.
- **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Design Considerations**:
  - **Image Optimization**: Images currently load in their original sizes; compression and optimization would reduce load times.
  - **Button Animations**: The "size" selection animations could be improved for smoother UX.
- **Credits**: If you’re the owner of any images used, please reach out for proper attribution.

Thanks for checking out the project!
